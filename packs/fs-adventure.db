You might find other spells during your adventures. You could discover a spell recorded on a scroll in an evil wizard's chest, for example, or in a dusty tome in an ancient library.</p><p><em><strong>Copying a Spell into the Book.</strong></em> When you find a wizard spell of 1st level or higher, you can add it to your spellbook if it is of a spell level you can prepare and if you can spare the time to decipher and copy it.</p><p>Copying that spell into your spellbook involves reproducing the basic form of the spell, then deciphering the unique system of notation used by the wizard who wrote it. You must practice the spell until you understand the sounds or gestures required, then transcribe it into your spellbook using your own notation.</p><p>For each level of the spell, the process takes 2 hours and costs 50 gp. The cost represents material components you expend as you experiment with the spell to master it, as well as the fine inks you need to record it. Once you have spent this time and money, you can prepare the spell just like your other spells.</p><p><em><strong>Replacing the Book.</strong></em> You can copy a spell from your own spellbook into another book—for example, if you want to make a backup copy of your spellbook. This is just like copying a new spell into your spellbook, but faster and easier, since you understand your own notation and already know how to cast the spell. You need spend only 1 hour and 10 gp for each level of the copied spell.</p><p>If you lose your spellbook, you can use the same procedure to transcribe the spells that you have prepared into a new spellbook. Filling out the remainder of your spellbook requires you to find new spells to do so, as normal. For this reason, many wizards keep backup spellbooks in a safe place.</p><p><em><strong>The Book's Appearance.</strong></em> Your spellbook is a unique compilation of spells, with its own decorative flourishes and margin notes. It might be a plain, functional leather volume that you received as a gift from your master, a finely bound gilt-edged tome you found in an ancient library, or even a loose collection of notes scrounged together after you lost your previous spellbook in a mishap.</p><h1>Arcane Traditions</h1><p>The study of wizardry is ancient, stretching back to the earliest mortal discoveries of magic. It is firmly established in fantasy gaming worlds, with various traditions dedicated to its complex study.</p><p>The most common arcane traditions in the multiverse revolve around the schools of magic. Wizards through the ages have cataloged thousands of spells, grouping them into eight categories called schools. In some places, these traditions are literally schools. In other institutions, the schools are more like academic departments, with rival faculties competing for students and funding. Even wizards who train apprentices in the solitude of their own towers use the division of magic into schools as a learning device, since the spells of each school require mastery of different techniques.</p><p>@Compendium[dnd5e.subclasses.Ye5f3FReEnuXfi0y]{School of Evocation}</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"SRD 5.1","identifier":"wizard","levels":5,"hitDice":"d6","hitDiceUsed":0,"advancement":[{"_id":"6x1gwvf02qraedhe","type":"HitPoints","configuration":{},"value":{"1":"max","2":"avg","3":"avg","4":"avg","5":"avg"},"title":""},{"_id":"9ojqd2dejdsffabi","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.gbNo5eVPaqr8IVKL","Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.e0uTcFPpgxjIyUW9"],"optional":false,"spell":{"ability":"","preparation":"","uses":{"max":"","per":""}}},"value":{"added":{"lmNXdNBpHJg9dsPW":"Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.gbNo5eVPaqr8IVKL","EtpWxuF3I4egW9s2":"Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.e0uTcFPpgxjIyUW9"}},"level":1,"title":"Features"},{"_id":"o0xix805mucymjbt","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.AEWr9EMxy5gj4ZFT"],"optional":false,"spell":{"ability":"","preparation":"","uses":{"max":"","per":""}}},"value":{"added":{"lSCzGB2kaRyrOor2":"Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.AEWr9EMxy5gj4ZFT"}},"level":2,"title":"Features"},{"_id":"sg6rj5gth6ljcbkg","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.JfFfHTeIszx1hNRx"],"optional":false,"spell":{"ability":"","preparation":"","uses":{"max":"","per":""}}},"value":{},"level":18,"title":"Features"},{"_id":"hoi88xqc3e5je60f","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.nUrZDi6QN1YjwAr6","Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.31bKbWe9ZGVLEns6"],"optional":false,"spell":{"ability":"","preparation":"","uses":{"max":"","per":""}}},"value":{},"level":20,"title":"Features"},{"_id":"87B6Xy0bCdddGTau","type":"ScaleValue","configuration":{"identifier":"cantrips-known","type":"number","distance":{"units":""},"scale":{"1":{"value":3},"4":{"value":4},"10":{"value":5}}},"value":{},"title":"Cantrips Known"}],"saves":["int","wis"],"skills":{"number":2,"choices":["arc","his","ins","inv","med","rel"],"value":[]},"spellcasting":{"progression":"full","ability":"int"}},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":0,"dBogmx4vpeLG8Oap":3},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Compendium.dnd5e.classes.wZK2Q0rXB0AQo8h3"}},"_stats":{"systemId":"dnd5e","systemVersion":"2.1.5","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1661787234283,"modifiedTime":1682438465335,"lastModifiedBy":"dBogmx4vpeLG8Oap"}},{"_id":"lmNXdNBpHJg9dsPW","name":"Spellcasting (Wizard)","ownership":{"default":0,"dBogmx4vpeLG8Oap":3},"type":"feat","system":{"description":{"value":"<p>As a student of arcane magic, you have a spellbook containing spells that show the first glimmerings of your true power.</p>\n<h5>Cantrips</h5>\n<p>At 1st level, you know three cantrips of your choice from the wizard spell list.

You use your Intelligence whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Intelligence modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a wizard spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p>\n<p><strong>Spell save DC</strong> = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier</p>\n<p><strong>Spell attack modifier </strong>= your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier</p>\n<h5>Ritual Casting</h5>\n<p>You can cast a wizard spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell in your spellbook.

Instead, they meditate deeply, remaining semiconscious, for 4 hours a day. (The Common word for such meditation is \"trance.\") While meditating, you can dream after a fashion; such dreams are actually mental exercises that have become reflexive through years of practice. After resting in this way, you gain the same benefit that a human does from 8 hours of sleep.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Languages.</strong></em> You can speak, read, and write Common and Elvish. Elvish is fluid, with subtle intonations and intricate grammar. Elven literature is rich and varied, and their songs and poems are famous among other races. Many bards learn their language so they can add Elvish ballads to their repertoires.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"SRD 5.1","activation":{"type":"","cost":null,"condition":""},"duration":{"value":"","units":""},"cover":null,"target":{"value":null,"width":null,"units":"","type":""},"range":{"value":null,"long":null,"units":""},"uses":{"value":null,"max":"","per":null,"recovery":""},"consume":{"type":"","target":null,"amount":null},"ability":null,"actionType":"","attackBonus":"","chatFlavor":"","critical":{"threshold":null,"damage":""},"damage":{"parts":[],"versatile":""},"formula":"","save":{"ability":"","dc":null,"scaling":"spell"},"type":{"value":"","subtype":""},"requirements":"","recharge":{"value":null,"charged":false}},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Compendium.dnd5e.races.rAGnsfgw3ZqAme1v"}},"img":"icons/magic/nature/leaf-glow-maple-teal.webp","effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"_stats":{"systemId":"dnd5e","systemVersion":"2.1.5","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1661787234474,"modifiedTime":1682135812314,"lastModifiedBy":"dBogmx4vpeLG8Oap"}},{"_id":"pzL6CgxDYJUdUUHK","name":"Fey Ancestry","ownership":{"default":0,"dBogmx4vpeLG8Oap":3},"type":"feat","system":{"description":{"value":"<p>You have advantage on saving throws against being charmed, and magic can't put you to sleep.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"SRD 5.1","activation":{"type":"","cost":null,"condition":""},"duration":{"value":"","units":""},"cover":null,"target":{"value":null,"width":null,"units":"","type":""},"range":{"value":null,"long":null,"units":""},"uses":{"value":null,"max":"","per":null,"recovery":""},"consume":{"type":"","target":null,"amount":null},"ability":"","actionType":"","attackBonus":"","chatFlavor":"","critical":{"threshold":null,"damage":""},"damage":{"parts":[],"versatile":""},"formula":"","save":{"ability":"","dc":null,"scaling":"spell"},"type":{"value":"race","subtype":""},"requirements":"Elf, Half-Elf","recharge":{"value":null,"charged":false}},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Compendium.dnd5e.races.cnTbpPPeGW7vGjOV"}},"img":"icons/creatures/mammals/elk-moose-marked-green.webp","effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":-100000,"_stats":{"systemId":"dnd5e","systemVersion":"2.1.5","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1661787234471,"modifiedTime":1682135814139,"lastModifiedBy":"dBogmx4vpeLG8Oap"}},{"name":"Fighting Style: Defense","ownership":{"default":0,"dBogmx4vpeLG8Oap":3},"type":"feat","system":{"description":{"value":"<p>While you are wearing armor, you gain a +1 bonus to AC</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"SRD 5.1","activation":{"type":"","cost":null,"condition":""},"duration":{"value":"","units":""},"cover":null,"target":{"value":null,"width":null,"units":"","type":""},"range":{"value":null,"long":null,"units":""},"uses":{"value":null,"max":"","per":null,"recovery":""},"consume":{"type":"","target":null,"amount":null},"ability":"","actionType":"","attackBonus":"","chatFlavor":"","critical":{"threshold":null,"damage":""},"damage":{"parts":[],"versatile":""},"formula":"","save":{"ability":"","dc":null,"scaling":"spell"},"type":{"value":"class","subtype":"fightingStyle"},"requirements":"Fighter 1, Champion 10, Paladin 2, Ranger 2","recharge":{"value":null,"charged":false}},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.zSlV0O2rQMdoq6pB"}},"img":"icons/equipment/shield/heater-stone-orange.webp","effects":[{"_id":"U3so0zDcVt4sIBRz","flags":{},"changes":[{"key":"system.attributes.ac.bonus","value":"+1","mode":2,"priority":null}],"disabled":false,"duration":{"startTime":null,"seconds":null,"combat":null,"rounds":null,"turns":null,"startRound":null,"startTurn":null},"icon":"icons/equipment/shield/heater-stone-orange.webp","label":"Fighting Style: Defense","origin":"Item.4mQUDmiDBePkQD6Y","tint":null,"transfer":true}],"_stats":{"systemId":"dnd5e","systemVersion":"2.1.5","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1661787234445,"modifiedTime":1682135808973,"lastModifiedBy":"dBogmx4vpeLG8Oap"},"folder":null,"sort":100000,"_id":"BSNKiHQkCyd1zhiQ"},{"folder":"y23uUW8Ex6fJ1yvy","name":"Informant","type":"background","img":"modules/flying-squad/images/icons/hooded-character.webp","system":{"description":{"value":"<p>You were an undercover member of a shadowy organization who reported on their criminal activities to the City Watch, whether out of moral compunction or financial necessity is beside the point.</p><p><strong>Skill Proficiencies:</strong> Deception, Stealth</p><p><strong>Tool Proficiencies:</strong> thieves' tools</p><p><strong>Feature: Alternate Identity</strong></p><p>You have a second identity: a different name, a different job, a different backstory, a different set of friends.

paladin to the cause of righteousness, an active path of fighting wickedness. The final oath, taken when he or she reaches 3rd level, is the culmination of all the paladin's training. Some characters with this class don't consider themselves true paladins until they have reached 3rd level and made this oath. For others, the actual swearing of the oath is a formality, an official stamp on what has always been true in the paladin's heart.</p>\n<p>@Compendium[dnd5e.subclasses.sZ86mbX8D5PfYuhl]{Oath of Devotion}</p>\n<h3>Breaking Your Oath</h3>\n<p>A paladin tries to hold to the highest standards of conduct, but even the most virtuous paladin is fallible. Sometimes the right path proves too demanding, sometimes a situation calls for the lesser of two evils, and sometimes the heat of emotion causes a paladin to transgress his or her oath.</p>\n<p>A paladin who has broken a vow typically seeks absolution from a cleric who shares his or her faith or from another paladin of the same order. The paladin might spend an allnight vigil in prayer as a sign of penitence, or undertake a fast or similar act of self-denial. After a rite of confession and forgiveness, the paladin starts fresh.</p>\n<p>If a paladin willfully violates his or her oath and shows no sign of repentance, the consequences can be more serious. At the GM's discretion, an impenitent paladin might be forced to abandon this class and adopt another.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"SRD 5.1","identifier":"paladin","levels":5,"hitDice":"d10","hitDiceUsed":0,"advancement":[{"_id":"z2d0fxi8e24gradq","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.E8ozg8avUVOX9N7u","Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.OdrvL3afwLOPeuYZ"],"optional":false,"spell":{"ability":"","preparation":"","uses":{"max":"","per":""}}},"value":{"added":{"nJyMWe5TuDAvvfLE":"Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.E8ozg8avUVOX9N7u","ZA0LCJhDIVjRsvCI":"Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.OdrvL3afwLOPeuYZ"}},"level":1,"title":"Features"},{"_id":"xy3wlxtiwbplsms7","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.Ho7dVxBlOYFlfBHk","Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.ihoQHsmVZlyDbPhX","Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.ySMPQ6zNSlvkrl2f"],"optional":false,"spell":{"ability":"","preparation":"","uses":{"max":"","per":""}}},"value":{"added":{"Rdg2Q7HOkDEUpQc9":"Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.Ho7dVxBlOYFlfBHk","Heigy7DDCNgQ07SJ":"Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.ihoQHsmVZlyDbPhX","kAIkBu1covigBnXc":"Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.ySMPQ6zNSlvkrl2f"}},"level":2,"title":"Features"},{"_id":"v26vmuy5lpsu5g4c","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.dY9yrqkyEDuF0CG2","Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.olAqNsUTIef9x8xC","Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.8M7uOPhbTxoxxJSo"],"optional":false,"spell":{"ability":"","preparation":"","uses":{"max":"","per":""}}},"value":{"added":{"bRl5dVj80A4RMc2D":"Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.dY9yrqkyEDuF0CG2","ZGIxdStVfOUkJpTG":"Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.olAqNsUTIef9x8xC","TMZy9SOpIjXn0awf":"Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.8M7uOPhbTxoxxJSo"}},"level":3,"title":"Features"},{"_id":"m3ytemj4ygib8c5m","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.XogoBnFWmCAHXppo"],"optional":false,"spell":{"ability":"","preparation":"","uses":{"max":"","per":""}}},"value":{"added":{"O6W9gZUbrkQV18w0":"Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.XogoBnFWmCAHXppo"}},"level":5,"title":"Features"},{"_id":"w3n62vbfeo3c7a90","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.carGDhkIdoduTC0I"],"optional":false,"spell":{"ability":"","preparation":"","uses":{"max":"","per":""}}},"value":{},"level":6,"title":"Features"},{"_id":"ers71klsl2dcjpfa","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.nahSkBO6LH4HkpaT"],"optional":false,"spell":{"ability":"","preparation":"","uses":{"max":"","per":""}}},"value":{},"level":10,"title":"Features"},{"_id":"kxodggik4e56u85t","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.FAk41RPCTcvCk6KI"],"optional":false,"spell":{"ability":"","preparation":"","uses":{"max":"","per":""}}},"value":{},"level":11,"title":"Features"},{"_id":"3x1u7nnxv8ftkt0d","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.U7BIPVPsptBmwsnV"],"optional":false,"spell":{"ability":"","preparation":"","uses":{"max":"","per":""}}},"value":{},"level":14,"title":"Features"},{"_id":"ebo3padd7vg4jg3g","type":"HitPoints","configuration":{},"value":{"1":"max","2":"avg","3":"avg","4":"avg","5":"avg"},"title":""}],"saves":["wis","cha"],"skills":{"number":2,"choices":["ath","ins","itm","med","per","rel"],"value":[]},"spellcasting":{"progression":"half","ability":"cha"}},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":0,"dBogmx4vpeLG8Oap":3},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Compendium.dnd5e.classes.gZiUvbXWLs0pOp0c"}},"_stats":{"systemId":"dnd5e","systemVersion":"2.1.5","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1661787234280,"modifiedTime":1682123388765,"lastModifiedBy":"dBogmx4vpeLG8Oap"}},{"_id":"nJyMWe5TuDAvvfLE","name":"Divine Sense","ownership":{"default":0,"dBogmx4vpeLG8Oap":3},"type":"feat","system":{"description":{"value":"<p>The presence of strong evil registers on your senses like a noxious odor, and powerful good rings like heavenly music in your ears.

In addition, you use your Charisma modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a paladin spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p>\n<p><strong>Spell save DC</strong> = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier</p>\n<p><strong>Spell attack modifier </strong>= your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier</p>\n<h5>Spellcasting Focus</h5>\n<p>You can use a holy symbol as a spellcasting focus for your paladin spells.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"SRD 5.1","activation":{"type":"","cost":null,"condition":""},"duration":{"value":"","units":""},"cover":null,"target":{"value":null,"width":null,"units":"","type":""},"range":{"value":null,"long":null,"units":""},"uses":{"value":null,"max":"","per":null,"recovery":""},"consume":{"type":"","target":null,"amount":null},"ability":null,"actionType":"","attackBonus":"","chatFlavor":"","critical":{"threshold":null,"damage":""},"damage":{"parts":[],"versatile":""},"formula":"","save":{"ability":"","dc":null,"scaling":"spell"},"type":{"value":"class","subtype":""},"requirements":"Paladin 2","recharge":{"value":null,"charged":false}},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":700000,"ownership":{"default":0,"dBogmx4vpeLG8Oap":3},"flags":{"dnd5e":{"sourceId":"Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.ihoQHsmVZlyDbPhX","advancementOrigin":"7wL2VcFnJ2SZ8hkM.xy3wlxtiwbplsms7"}},"_stats":{"systemId":"dnd5e","systemVersion":"2.1.5","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1661787234411,"modifiedTime":1682123904500,"lastModifiedBy":"dBogmx4vpeLG8Oap"}},{"_id":"kAIkBu1covigBnXc","name":"Divine Smite","ownership":{"default":0,"dBogmx4vpeLG8Oap":3},"type":"feat","system":{"description":{"value":"<p>Starting at 2nd level, when you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack, you can expend one spell slot to deal radiant damage to the target, in addition to the weapon's damage.</p><p>The extra damage is 2d8 for a 1st-level spell slot, plus 1d8 for each spell level higher than 1st, to a maximum of 5d8.

You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</p>\n<p>You prepare the list of cleric spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the cleric spell list. When you do so, choose a number of cleric spells equal to your Wisdom modifier + your cleric level (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</p>\n<p>For example, if you are a 3rd-level cleric, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With a Wisdom of 16, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination. If you prepare the 1st-level spell cure wounds, you can cast it using a 1st-level or 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn't remove it from your list of prepared spells.</p>\n<p>You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of cleric spells requires time spent in prayer and meditation: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.</p>\n<h5>Spellcasting Ability</h5>\n<p>Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your cleric spells. The power of your spells comes from your devotion to your deity. You use your Wisdom whenever a cleric spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a cleric spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p>\n<p><strong>Spell save DC</strong>= 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier</p>\n<p><strong>Spell attack modifier</strong> = your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier</p>\n<h5>Ritual Casting</h5>\n<p>You can cast a cleric spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell prepared.</p>\n<h5>Spellcasting Focus</h5>\n<p>You can use a holy symbol (see @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.rules.BYFd9hiJGo9L5aOM.JournalEntryPage.AjavRU4yPfI9hfaI]{Adventuring Gear}) as a spellcasting focus for your cleric spells.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"SRD 5.1","activation":{"type":"","cost":null,"condition":""},"duration":{"value":"","units":""},"cover":null,"target":{"value":null,"width":null,"units":"","type":""},"range":{"value":null,"long":null,"units":""},"uses":{"value":null,"max":"","per":null,"recovery":""},"consume":{"type":"","target":null,"amount":null},"ability":null,"actionType":"","attackBonus":"","chatFlavor":"","critical":{"threshold":null,"damage":""},"damage":{"parts":[],"versatile":""},"formula":"","save":{"ability":"","dc":null,"scaling":"spell"},"type":{"value":"class","subtype":""},"requirements":"Cleric 1","recharge":{"value":null,"charged":false}},"flags":{"dnd5e":{"sourceId":"Compendium.dnd5e.classfeatures.v4gKwLhAq9vuqza7","advancementOrigin":"VkCXk9J4cGd1Bz0V.x1zumbrnbhqlrrs6"}},"img":"icons/magic/life/ankh-gold-blue.webp","effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":800000,"_stats":{"systemId":"dnd5e","systemVersion":"2.1.5","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1661787234436,"modifiedTime":1682705355196,"lastModifiedBy":"dBogmx4vpeLG8Oap"}},{"_id":"pFrkOTUvsx7TmBhR","name":"Divine Domain","ownership":{"default":0,"dBogmx4vpeLG8Oap":3},"type":"feat","system":{"description":{"value":"<p>Choose one domain related to your deity, such as Life.

paladin to the cause of righteousness, an active path of fighting wickedness. The final oath, taken when he or she reaches 3rd level, is the culmination of all the paladin's training. Some characters with this class don't consider themselves true paladins until they have reached 3rd level and made this oath. For others, the actual swearing of the oath is a formality, an official stamp on what has always been true in the paladin's heart.</p>\n<p>@Compendium[dnd5e.subclasses.sZ86mbX8D5PfYuhl]{Oath of Devotion}</p>\n<h3>Breaking Your Oath</h3>\n<p>A paladin tries to hold to the highest standards of conduct, but even the most virtuous paladin is fallible. Sometimes the right path proves too demanding, sometimes a situation calls for the lesser of two evils, and sometimes the heat of emotion causes a paladin to transgress his or her oath.</p>\n<p>A paladin who has broken a vow typically seeks absolution from a cleric who shares his or her faith or from another paladin of the same order.

They seem to be associated with the temple just to the west. They are always singing and wailing, and many of the neighbors don't like it.</p><h2>B: Well</h2><p>The well seems to be a public gathering place, with a woman singing and telling stories to a small audience. They are laughing and joking.</p><p>Some neighbors complain about them making too much noise.</p><h2>C: Brazier</h2><p>Some people are gathered around a brazier, cooking sausages on skewers and drinking ale. They do this every night during the summer, and make a lot of noise, and the neighbors complain.</p><p>A couple of them hang around all day, shooting the breeze.</p><h2>D: Private Park</h2><p>High stone walls surround what looks like a private park in the middle of the city.</p><p>A tiefling druid named @UUID[Actor.o5R828tfvBrZ8iJc]{Xanaphia} lives in a tree in . She came into a fortune some years ago and bought this prime real estate in the middle of the city. She holds druidic ceremonies here on holy days for all to come, singing and chanting. There's no temple, just the trees.</p><p>A @UUID[Actor.yLGIQxlvDfKjtqfE]{raven} and two @UUID[Actor.rKuBpWqOKn8oZlOg]{wolves} also reside in the park. The raven watches overhead and alerts Xanaphia if anyone tries to enter the area. The wolves are tamed by Xanaphia, but will attack anyone who threatens her.</p><p>The neighbors complain about the noise, and some actively dislike druids and tieflings.</p><p>She knows Larrabee and Gelba's secret, and will help them if they come to her. If the officers try to kill Larrabee she offer another solution: <em>remove curse</em>. Unfortunately, that magic is beyond Xanaphia's capabilities, otherwise she would have cured them long ago.</p><h1>Houses and Vendors</h1><p>Houses that have a token near the stairs with its invisibility status toggled off have a person home. When the officers knock toggle their status to visible. (Right-click the token and click the upper right icon.)</p><p>No one is home at the others, except for house 7, which has Larrabee, Gelba and Luna home, but they will not answer the door.</p><h2>1. Saraf</h2><p>This is the smallest house in the neighborhood. When the officers knock and old woman comes to the door immediately. She is Saraf, and she knows Larrabee and Gelba. She is the neighborhood busybody.</p><p>She says, \"Oh, yes, I heard the howling. Every month. The howling, the screaming. And then, the next day, they're all lovey-dovey again.\"</p><p>She knows that Gelba was pregnant last year, but she has never seen the child. However, there is child-sized clothing hanging on the clothesline, so she assumes they had the kid.</p><p>She also knows that Larrabee is frequently gone for long trips. She thinks he's some kind of guide or hunter.</p><h2>2. Washer Woman</h2><p>This woman is washing clothes in a tub of water and hanging them up to dry over the street. Roll on the @UUID[RollTable.T4q2tibzr3dQCkl7]{Howling Complaints} table.</p><h2>4: Cider Seller</h2><p>This person sells cider. People come up and she fills their jugs. Roll on the @UUID[RollTable.T4q2tibzr3dQCkl7]{Howling Complaints} table.</p><h2>5: Vegetable Stand</h2><p>This person sells vegetables. Roll on the @UUID[RollTable.T4q2tibzr3dQCkl7]{Howling Complaints} table.</p><h2>6: Dry Goods</h2><p>This person sells dry goods: flour, tea, sugar, oats, etc. Roll on the @UUID[RollTable.T4q2tibzr3dQCkl7]{Howling Complaints} table.</p><h2>7: Larrabee's House</h2><p>A Perception check (DC 15) reveals blood stains on the door handle and threshold of this house. The red w's indicate the locations of windows, which are curtained off, if the officers are trying to guard any possible exits.</p><p>When the officers knock Gelba will try to stay quiet. Roll officers' Wisdom (Perception) check at DC 12 to hear Luna in the other room playing, singing, growling and yelping with her toys, and Gelba shushing Luna. If the officers persist in knocking for more than a few minutes, or say something like, \"We know you're in there. We can hear you,\" Gelba will open the door.</p><p><em>When she does, switch to the \"Werehouse\" scene in the Wary Werewolf scene folder.</em></p><p>If the officers try to arrest Larrabee, he will transform into a werewolf hybrid and flee via a circuitous route, trying to elude pursuers, to area D to get help from Xanaphia. He will disengage from combat when possible, and will only bite if he is grappled and is trying to escape.</p><p>To shapechange Larrabee:</p><ul><li><p>Double-click Larrabee's token in the scene to open the character sheet.</p></li><li><p>Open the Actors tab in the right sidebar and click the Wary Werewolf folder.</p></li><li><p>Click and drag the Werewolf actor on to Larrabee's character sheet.</p></li><li><p>Click the Appearance Only button.</p></li></ul><p>To shift Larrabee back to human form reopen the character sheet and click the Restore Transformation button in the character sheet window header.</p><h3>a. Kitchen</h3><p>A table, four chairs, a fireplace, cupboards for food storage, etc. The legs of the table and chairs are very gnawed. Children's toys are under the table.</p><p>Two spears lean against the wall not far from the door, a large tent lies folded on the floor to the right, camping gear is across the room in an alcove.</p><p>If the officers attack Gelba she will start to shapeshift into werewolf form but will immediately shift back. She will resist, but has enough willpower to avoid biting anyone.</p><p>Larrabee makes his living by hiring out as a guide and tracker, which he is excellent at. He can't work at the full moon, so he always makes sure he's back in town at that time to get a heart from Henk.</p><h3>b. Bathroom</h3><p>A tub with children's toys scattered about.</p><h3>c. Bedroom</h3><p>Larrabee is hiding here. When he hears the knock at the door he will undo the latch on the window and prepare to escape through it. If he hears the officers enter the kitchen he will escape through the window and flee to area D and seek help from Xanaphia.</p><h3>d. Luna's Bedroom</h3><p>A small bed, two pillows, a dresser with clothing, and a small hybrid werewolf!</p><p>Larrabee's and Gelba's child Luna is locked in her room. Perception check (DC 12) to hear her whining and growling to be let out if there has been noise in the kitchen. She is in hybrid form for several days around the full moon.</p><h1>Conclusion</h1><p>Larrabee did kill Henk, and he feels terrible about it. He wants to turn himself in, but he worries about Gelba and Luna.

Ladders Up to Street</h1><p>This ladder leads up to a very heavy grate in the street that can be lifted aside (DC 14 Strength check). During the day daylight brightens the areas around the ladders.</p><h1>4. Strange Light</h1><p>A strange light flickers under the door on the south side of the sewer tunnel.</p><p>Inside the room are two @UUID[Actor.MNmzMHKBxvhncPna]{wights}.</p><p>This was once a storage room for the business above, but it was forgotten years ago.</p><h1>5.

It contains crates and barrels filled with dry goods.</p><p>The door opens into the room, but is blocked with crates, in addition to being locked with a rusted lock. It can be forced with a DC 20 Strength check, or it can be picked with a DC 20 Thieves Tools check and a DC 14 Strength check to push the door and the crates aside enough to gain entry.</p><h1>8. Secret Door</h1><p>The secret door in the north wall is skillfully hidden. A loose stone is pressed to open it, and it swings inward.</p><p>A successful Wisdom (Perception) check at DC 14 will reveal that the surface here is much cleaner than elsewhere (because the ghouls are very careful to remove their tracks when they enter, not realizing that they're also removing the grime that's everywhere else in the sewer.</p><h1>9. Malevolent Spirits</h1><p>Shattered bones lie strewn all along the floor of this chamber, which was carved out of the sandstone by hand — or perhaps by claws. In the back a glint of metal is visible.</p><blockquote><p>This tunnel was bored out by the ghouls, but has since been overrun by @UUID[Actor.FAYJVCIQZbNHufRR]{Malevolent Spirits} of those slain by the ghouls. They hide out in the floor and walls and attack any creatures that enter the chamber.</p></blockquote><p><strong>Treasure: </strong>there is a chest that contains the treasure the ghouls had accumulated before they were driven out by the spirits of their victims. They have tried several times to recover it, but have given up.</p><p>The chest contains the following items.</p><p><span style=\"font-family:'Trebuchet MS', Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif\">3</span>,206 gp in coinage:</p><ul><li>100 pp</li><li>1,700 gp</li><li>5,000 sp</li><li>600 cp</li></ul><p>25 gp art objects (×6; worth 150 gp total):</p><ul><li>Small mirror set in a painted wooden frame</li><li>Pair of engraved bone dice</li><li>Black velvet mask stitched with silver thread</li><li>Gold locket with a painted portrait inside</li><li>Small gold bracelet</li><li>Silver ewer</li></ul><p>Magic Items</p><ul><li>Potion of Healing</li></ul><h1>10.

Unless the officers have been extremely stealthy and haven't fought anything, the ghouls will be lying in wait. They are hiding around the corners in 11 and 12.</p><p>When the officers come within 10 feet of this area make DC 12 Wisdom (Perception) check. If successful they smell the stench of death, and a successful DC 14 Intelligence (Arcana) roll reveals that a ghast is nearby.</p><p>Four piles of straw, blankets and pillows lie on the floor in 11. Another bed is in 12, as well as a brazier filled with cracked bones from which the marrow has been sucked, apparently human.</p><p><strong>Treasure: </strong>the ghouls have their treasure in a chest in a niche of the south wall of 12. They are just scraping by now, having been driven out of their original lair by the malevolent spirits of their victims.</p><h1>13. Empty Chamber</h1><p>The ghouls have been working on carving out this chamber, but have done nothing with it yet.</p><h1>14. Bobbing Lights</h1><p>When the squad approaches the entrance to this chamber they will notice a green light at the end of the entrance tunnel, shining from the from the right.</p><p>There are four @UUID[Actor.ZzUMLyVkKYnIxkG2]{Will-o'-Wisps} here, entranced by a man standing frozen in the chamber, emanating a strange light. The creatures keep weaving around him, trying to get to him, but they can't reach him.</p><p>The man is Timon, a thief/spy who blundered in here looking for a safe haven. He has a magic ring that he paid dearly for, and was told would protect him from imminent danger. The ring puts up an impenetrable force shield when a command word is uttered, making the wearer immune to all damage for 1 minute. It has three charges and regains 1d3 charges each day at dawn. However, it's rather flaky and there's a 1 in 6 chance that it will also freeze the wearer in time until <em>dispel magic </em>is cast on the wearer. Whether this is a sign decaying magic, a bad joke by the ring's maker, or a sign of their incompetence is not known.</p><p><em>Be sure to show the players @UUID[Actor.as8LWBgBsT22HyHE]{Timon's} portrait (right-click him in the Actors tab and select View Character Artwork) in case the players looked at the bulletin board. Reward the player who realizes Timon is wanted with an Inspiration.</em></p><p>Timon is wanted by the authorities for espionage and trespassing. He is associated with the Rats and scouts out locations for robberies, as well as surveilling assassination targets to learn their vulnerabilities.</p><p>If <em>dispel magic</em> is cast on him the ring will deactivate and Timon will be able to move again.</p>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"JournalEntry.74x8sFNKT2zFyQ5S.JournalEntryPage.CUxJap1RPz40e8aT"}}}],"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":0,"dBogmx4vpeLG8Oap":3},"flags":{},"_stats":{"systemId":"dnd5e","systemVersion":"2.1.5","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1682357024663,"modifiedTime":1682778120870,"lastModifiedBy":"dBogmx4vpeLG8Oap"},"_id":"W5aqYrWAOeZCB5HM"}],"scenes":[{"name":"Ghastly
